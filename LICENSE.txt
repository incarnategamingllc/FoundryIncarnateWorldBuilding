INCARNATE GENERAL LICENSE (v 1.0 July, 9 2018)
LICENSE/END USER AGREEMENT

This License/End User Agreement (the "Agreement") is made by and between
Incarnate Gaming LLC, an Ohio limited liability company ("Licensor," "We,"
"Our," or "Us"), and the end user of the Program distributed by Licensor
("Licensee" or "You").

	By installing, using, or accessing Licensor's Program You agree
to be bound by this Agreement as follows:


1.	License.  

(a)	Grant of License.  
With the exception of Third Party Content as addressed below, the Program,
including text, photographs, images, graphics, designs, trademarks, audio,
video, games, applications, items, software and files is proprietary of
Licensor.  Licensor hereby grants you a limited, non-exclusive,
non-transferrable, non-sublicensable, and fully revocable license to use
the Program on your Device solely for your personal and entertainment use. 
Commercial use is permitted only as delineated herein.  Except as permitted
by this Agreement, you may not copy, modify, translate, distribute, transmit,
publish, republish, perform, display, post, download, upload, frame, make
available, lend, hire, communicate to the public, adapt, or sell the Program. 
Any unauthorized use of the Program may violate copyright, trademark, patent,
trade secret, and/or other applicable laws and regulations and will result
in the termination of this license. Except only as expressly set forth in
this Agreement, this Agreement does not grant to you any license to any
intellectual property rights or other proprietary rights and does not
grant any independent license to any Third Party Content governed by its
own license.  You are not required to accept this Agreement since you have
not signed it, however, nothing else grants you permission to use, modify,
or distribute the Program or any Derivative Materials therefrom. These
actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this Agreement.
Therefore, by using, modifying, and/or distributing the Program (or any
work based thereon), you indicate your acceptance of this Agreement by
doing so, and all its terms and conditions.

(b)	Compliance with Third-Party Terms. 

This license is conditional on your compliance with the terms and
conditions of any license agreement for Third Party Content including,
but not limited to, those referenced or reproduced on the Schedules
attached hereto and incorporated herein.

(c)	Reservation. 

Licensor reserves all other rights related to the program. 
Licensee agree that the Program is at all times licensed and not sold. 
Licensee agrees that aspects of the Program, including the specific
design and code of the Program, constitute trade secrets and/or
copyrighted material of Licensor. 

(d)	Use. 

(1)	Generally. 
Licensee's use of the Program requires a compatible Device, internet
access, and certain software (fees may apply to utilize all aspects
of such software); may require periodic updates; and may be affected
by the performance of these factors.  High-speed internet access is
strongly recommended.  The latest version of the Program is recommended
and may be required.  Licensee agrees that meeting these requirements,
which may change from time to time, is its responsibility.  Licensor
may issue optional or mandatory updates to the Program from time to
time. 

(2)	Error Reporting.
Licensee shall report any and all errors, glitches, bugs, malfunctions,
defects, crashes, freezes, or the like (an "Error") to Licensor as soon
as possible specifically identifying the Error encountered, the date
and time of the Error, and the portion of the Program in use at the
time of the Error.  Licensor shall take all diligent efforts to remedy
the Error in an expeditious fashion.  Licensor shall provide an
estimated repair schedule to Licensee upon the reporting of an Error. 
Licensee specifically acknowledges that some Error repairs shall take
priority over others depending on the severity of the impact of the Error
on the operation of the program.

(3)	Licensee Conduct. 
(A) Licensee shall not take any conduct that (i) infringes, misappropriates,
or violates a Third Party's rights (including intellectual property rights)
in the use of the Program or in the creation of any Derivative Materials;
(ii) violates, or encourages any conduct that would violate, any applicable
law or regulation or would give rise to civil liability; (iii) is fraudulent,
false, misleading, or deceptive; (iv) is defamatory, obscene, pornographic,
vulgar, or offensive; promotes discrimination, bigotry, racism, hatred,
harassment, or harm against any individual or group; (v) is violent or
threatening or promotes violence or actions that are threatening to
any other person; or promotes illegal or harmful activities or substances
(including but not limited to activities that promote or provide
instructional information regarding the manufacture or purchase of
illegal weapons or illegal substances). 
(B) You represent and warrant that (i) you are not located in a country
that is subject to a U.S. Government embargo, or that has been designated
by the U.S. Government as a "terrorist supporting" country; and (ii) you
are not listed on any U.S. Government list of prohibited or restricted
parties.  Licensor reserves the right to investigate and take legal
action against violators of this Agreement as appropriate; and
(C) You may not use any Derivative Material for anything other than
your personal use unless it was created or approved in writing by the
Author. 

(e)	License Termination.  

Licensee agrees that this Agreement shall immediately terminate,
and Licensee shall desist and forever abstain from using the Program
if Licensee breaches any portion of this Agreement or any license for
any Third Party Content.

(f)	Litigation.  

If you or anyone you represent initiate litigation against Author
asserting a patent infringement or other intellectual property claim
(excluding declaratory judgment actions, counter-claims, and cross-claims)
alleging that the Program or any part of the Program directly or
indirectly infringes on any patent then the rights granted to you under
this Agreement shall terminate.

(g)	Linking. 

Licensee may link to the Code in other works for both personal and
commercial use. 

(h)	Reviews. 

Licensee may write or record reviews and tutorials for the Code
on the internet or in print as long as such reviews and tutorials
do not teach people how to (i) create products like the Code or (ii)
replace the Code.

(i)	Generated Material. 

The Licensee may use Generated Material for commercial use if, and
only if, the links that are placed in the generated material are
maintained. This means that works using Generated Material will
require the presence of the Code to be fully usable.


2.	Purchase of Program.  

Licensor may allow you to use the Program free of charge or may
solicit donations from you for your download and use of the Program
and the Code.  Licensor may release the Program and Code through
various publicly accessible means, including, but not limited to
Dropbox, Google Drive, or GitHub.


3.	Limitation of Liability.

(a)	In no case shall Licensor, its directors, officers, employees,
affiliates, agents, contractors, or licensors be held liable for any
direct, indirect, incidental, punitive, special, or consequential
damages, including, without limitation, damages for loss of profits,
loss of data, business interruption, or any other commercial damages
or losses, regardless of the theory of liability (contract, tort, or
otherwise) arising from your use or inability to use the Program or
any part thereof, however caused, or for any other claim related in
any way to your use of the Program, including, but not limited to,
any errors or omissions in any content, or any loss or damage of any
kind incurred as a result of the use of any content (or product) posted,
transmitted, or otherwise made available via the Program, even if advised
of their possibility.  In no event will Licensor, any of its affiliates
or any of their respective officers, directors, employees, agents or
representatives be liable for lost profit, lost revenue or any other
form of indirect, incidental, special, consequential or punitive
damages, even if that party has been informed of the possibility
of such damages.  Because some states or jurisdictions do not allow
the exclusion or the limitation of liability for consequential or
incidental damages, in such states or jurisdictions, Licensor's
liability shall be limited to the extent permitted by law. 

(b)	Licensor does not represent or guarantee that the Program
will be free from loss, corruption, attack, viruses, interference,
hacking, or other security intrusion, and Licensor disclaims any
liability relating thereto.  Some information once entered into
the Program software cannot be replaced if lost for any reason.  


4.	No Representations or Warranties.  
LICENSOR  DOES NOT GUARANTEE, REPRESENT, OR WARRANT THAT LICENSEE'S
USE OF THE PROGRAM WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE, AND LICENSEE 
AGREES THAT, FROM TIME TO TIME, LICENSOR  MAY REMOVE ACCESS TO THE
PROGRAM FOR INDEFINITE PERIODS OF TIME, OR TO CONDUCT MAINTENANCE
OR REPAIRS WITH OR WITHOUT NOTICE TO LICENSEE. 
LICENSEE EXPRESSLY AGREES THAT ITS USE OF, OR INABILITY TO USE,
THE PROGRAM IS AT LICENSEE'S SOLE RISK.  THE PROGRAM AND ALL
PRODUCTS AND SERVICES DELIVERED TO LICENSEE  THROUGH THE PROGRAM
ARE (EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY STATED BY LICENSOR) PROVIDED "AS IS"
AND "AS AVAILABLE" FOR LICENSEE'S USE, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY
KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES
OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND
NON-INFRINGEMENT.  BECAUSE SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE
EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, THE ABOVE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED
WARRANTIES MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. 
TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW DOES NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSIONS AND
DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES AS SET FORTH ABOVE, SOME OR ALL OF THE
ABOVE EXCLUSIONS AND DISCLAIMERS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU, IN WHICH
CASE ALL WARRANTIES WILL BE LIMITED TO THE FULLEST EXTENT
PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE DISCLAIMERS
AND EXCLUSIONS CONTAINED HEREIN WILL SURVIVE ANY TERMINATION OR
EXPIRATION OF THIS AGREEMENT OR YOUR USE OF, OR ABILITY TO USE,
THE PROGRAM.


5.	Indemnification.  

From and after the Effective Date and to the extent permitted by
law, Licensee will defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Licensor
its directors, officers, employees, affiliates, agents,
contractors, and its affiliates from and against any loss,
liability, damage, claim, fine, or expense (including reasonable
attorneys' fees)(collectively, "Losses") suffered or incurred
by any such indemnified party arising from a Third-Party Claim
(as defined below) to the extent such Loss arises from or is
related to the Licensee's performance or nonperformance under
this Agreement, its use of the Program including any unauthorized
use of any patent, process, idea, method or device, or unfair
trade practice, false advertising, trademark infringement, or
the like.  "Third-Party Claim" means a claim or demand made by
any person not a party to this Agreement against the indemnified
party (other than a claim or demand made by a person that is an
affiliate of the indemnified party).  Licensee specifically
acknowledges that the Program is merely a tool to be utilized
by Licensee and that Licensor shall have no liability, in any
way, for the Generated Material produced by the Program to Licensee. 
Licensee shall only use the Generated Material for his/her personal
use.


6.	Term.  

This Agreement and the permissions, terms, and conditions herein,
shall continue for as long as you have the Program installed on a
Device that you own. 


7.	Amendments and Waiver.  

We reserve the right to change this Agreement at any time. 
If we change this Agreement in a material way, we will give notice of
that in our Program (or an updated version therein). Your use of the
Program after we have changed this Agreement will indicate your consent
to the updated Agreement.  No waiver by either Party of any term or
condition of this Agreement, in any one or more instances, will be
deemed to be or construed as a waiver of the same or any other
term or condition of this Agreement on any future occasion.  A
waiver of any term or condition of this Agreement must be in writing
and signed by the waiving Party.


8.	Miscellaneous.  

You accept this Agreement by downloading or using the Program. 
This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between you and
Licensor regarding your use of the Program. If any provision of
this Agreement is determined to be invalid or unenforceable such
provision will be deemed severed from this Agreement and the
remaining provisions of this Agreement will not be affected
thereby and will continue to be binding upon you and fully
enforceable. The failure of Licensor to insist upon strict
performance of any of the provisions contained in this Agreement
will not constitute a waiver of our rights, at law or in equity,
or a waiver of any other provisions or subsequent default by you
in the performance or compliance with any of the terms and conditions
of this Agreement. This Agreement and the license granted hereunder
may not be transferred or assigned by you, and any attempted
transfer or assignment will be void and ineffective. Licensor
may freely assign this Agreement and its rights and obligations
hereunder without restriction. We may provide notice to you through
the Program, our website, by email, or by any other means that you
may inform us of or are reasonably anticipated to provide you with
notice of changes to this Agreement.  All notices given by you to
us under this Agreement shall be made by mail to 3080 Dutch Hollow
Road, Elida, Ohio  45807, United States of America. Any litigation
relating to this Agreement may be brought only in the courts of a
jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of
business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that
jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions.

GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
Version 2, June 1991

Copyright © 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
59 Temple Place - Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307, USA

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

Preamble
The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.
When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.
Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.
Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.
TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you".
Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.
1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.
You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.
c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program is not required to print an announcement.)
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Program.
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.
3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.
If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance. 
5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.
6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.
7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.
8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.
9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.
10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
NO WARRANTY
11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
